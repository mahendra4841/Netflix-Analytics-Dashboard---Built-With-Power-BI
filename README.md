#ðŸš€ Netflix Analytics Dashboard - Built With Power BI ðŸ“Š 

Excited to share my latest Netflix Analytics Dashboard,
where I analyzed content trends, top genres , IMDb ratings,
 and country-wise content distribution using Power BI!

ðŸ”Ž**Key Insights:**
âœ… Content Volume Over Time

The number of shows (count of IDs) increased significantly from 2010 onward, peaking around 2019â€“2020 with over 200 titles per year.
After 2020, there's a slight decline in the number of releases.

âœ… IMDb Votes Over Time

The sum of IMDb votes saw major growth starting around 2010, peaking in 2016 (3.2M) and 2018 (3M).

Thereâ€™s a drop in votes in the most recent years (possibly due to newer content not accumulating votes yet).

âœ… Rating Trends

The average IMDb score has slightly declined over the years, especially post-2017.

Shows released around 2014â€“2017 had the highest average ratings.

âœ… Popular Shows by Rating Votes

Breaking Bad leads with a huge margin at 16M+ votes.

Followed by Stranger Things (9M), The Walking Dead (8M), Black Mirror (5M), and House of Cards (4M).

âœ…Age Certification and IMDb Scores

Content rated TV-14 and TV-MA has relatively higher average IMDb scores.

TV-G and TV-Y content tends to have lower ratings, possibly reflecting the younger audience's impact.

âœ… Runtime Trends

The average runtime has been steadily increasing over the years, peaking after 2020.

There's a noticeable jump in both total and average runtime, indicating a trend toward longer episodes or series.
